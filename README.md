# flask-api-mashup

Simple Flask mashup using some APIs to demonstrate how a web app can use APIs and combine them together.

Edit `config_sample.py`, put your tokens and config details in as appropriate, and rename it to `config.py`.

To run the app:

```
python app.py
```

### Note

This is a teaching exercise to help students explore some accessible APIs and understand how a Flask app can interact with them. The followon teaching exercises from this introduce jQuery, OAuth and caching -- this app is very simple by intent, but as a result doesn't embody some good practices you should use when building a non-learning-exercise app.
